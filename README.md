# My "Experience" üìñ

** The Odin Project üìú **
- Conquered HTML, CSS,(can center a div) and JavaScript with the fury of a caffeinated Norse god. Single-handedly wrestled the DOM into submission using only raw loops and sheer willpower.
- Constructed full-stack Ruby on Rails applications so robust they brought tears to the eyes of senior engineers (or so I imagined while debugging at 3 a.m.).
- Debugged code like a mythological hero battles hydras‚Äîcut off one error, and two more appeared. Still emerged victorious thanks to Stack Overflow and emotional fortitude :)
- Designed RESTful APIs so elegant they could've walked the runway at Paris Fashion Week. Consumed them with JavaScript like a well-balanced breakfast.

## Achievements ‚úåÔ∏è
- Debugged a single Rails migration for days upon days upon days upon days upon ...(you get it now), and FINALLY achieved cloud nine.
- Achieved inner peace while tracing a missing semicolon for 45 minutes.
- Developed sixth sense for Googling exactly the right keywords. Can now find that one obscure forum post from 2013 with surgical precision.
